How to Setup the PsychGH Project
================================

Getting the Project
===================

To get the latest, stable version of the PsychGH project, just run
``git clone https://github.com/tosty/psychgh.git``.

Project Layout
==============

After cloning the repository, you will see that we have three primary folders
in our project: ``public``, ``src``, and ``docs``.

 *  ``public`` contains all of the bootstrapping code for the React application.
 *  ``src`` contains all of PsychGH's logic, components, and style sheets.
 *  ``docs`` contains all of the files for the user and developer documentation.
